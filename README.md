### **Objective:**
The objective of this case study is to conduct an in-depth analysis of the combined supply chain and digital access datasets provided by DataCo Analysis Group. Students will utilize advanced Excel techniques to dissect these datasets, revealing key patterns and insights. The primary tasks include data cleaning, integration, analysis, and the development of a comprehensive, interactive dashboard. This dashboard will serve as a critical tool in visualizing supply chain efficiencies, customer engagement metrics, and the synergy between them. The project aims to augment DataCo Analysis Group's consulting capabilities, offering actionable insights to clients for optimizing supply chain processes and improving digital marketing strategies. This analysis is also expected to contribute to a broader understanding of how supply chain and online consumer behavior are interlinked, thereby influencing strategic decisions in product management, marketing, and customer relationship management.

Data Source:
Supply Chain Dataset:This dataset is designed to analyze aspects of the supply chain such as shipping efficiency, customer demographics, sales performance, and product popularity.
Access Logs DatasetThis dataset is for understanding user behavior on the website, the popularity of products, and the performance of different website sections.

### **Building an Excel Dashboard**

Leverage Excel's data visualization and interactive tools to create an insightful and dynamic dashboard. This dashboard should provide a clear and interactive overview of key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and insights in the supply chain and web access areas. The goal is to develop a tool that facilitates data-driven decision-making and offers a comprehensive understanding of the underlying business processes.
